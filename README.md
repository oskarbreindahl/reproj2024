# Research Project 2024
This repository contains code for measuring Python energy effieciency during benchmarking in Pyperformance.

## Prerequisites
- Installed Python versions on testing device.
- Installed Pyperfomance for each version.
- Experimental setup as described in project report found in this repo.
## Notes
- Script for producing graphs written by ChatGPT.
- otii_config.py heavily inspired by https://github.com/HelgeCPH/cpython_energy/blob/main/src/data_collection/run_experiment_from_host.py by Rolf-Helge Pfeiffer.
- pypower.sh must be copied to home folder of device running benchmarks in order to work.
